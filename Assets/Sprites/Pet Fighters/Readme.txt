As far as my part, I mainly just wanted to make the sprites easier to use. The quality is great, but the animations are complicated, so I wanted to organize them, and I wanted to release it to give back to the Open Game Art community. The cat sprite sheet was merely a matter of splitting it up, and organizing it. For the dog, I had to add transparency and do a bunch of realignment, as the original was not formatted consistently for 64x64. Then I cut it up and organized it, as I did with the cat. I included the original cat spritesheet as well as my modified dog spritesheet, and individual attributions in the appropriate folders.

I (Arsonide) would appreciate some form of credit, as it did take a few hours, but it is not necessary. The guys above did most of the work.
